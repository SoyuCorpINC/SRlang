com.say: = print function
usr.say: input string(eval)
usr.say:[ = input with numbers
calc: = automatically calculates whatever is next to it
x = = for user input(x = usr.say:)
x :: = for everything except inputs(x :: 'algeria, x :: 50)
if x :: 'something;execution = if statement
if x :: [number;execution = if statement(with numbers)
if x >: = if statement if x is bigger then number
if x <: = if statement if x is smaller then number
rnd.say:number1;number2 = generate a random number number between n1 and n2
browser:|var| = open a page from a variable
browser: = open web page through a string
|var| = use this for com.say:, browser, etc for identifying variables
DSUM = generates a random cat (^0x0^)
stop; = quits the program
loop: = (name is quite odd)runs a .sr file
x += = add to variable
x -= = removes from variable
access:|var| = opens a file through a variable
access: = opens a file from a string
the only variables you can properly use right now are
x,y,z
meaning the language has a limited storage system for variables.
But with future progress this might change.
Right now the program is designed to be easily picked up by people,
due to its more english-like syntax.
